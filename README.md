# Fabio's dotfiles

An opinionated collection of useful setups and dotfiles with inspiration from @paulirish, @mathiasbynens, @alrra.

## Setup

- Clone the repo into `~/dotfiles`
- Run `~/dotfiles/setup.sh` to setup a new machine once
- Run `~/dotfiles/symlink.sh` to setup all symlinks

## Features

- Homebrew in `~/homebrew` for use in multi-user machines
- Homebrew cask in `~/homebrew-cask` with applications in `~/Applications`
- Colored output for grep, ls and git
- Aliases, including git and ls
- Simple prompt

## Todo

- More testing would certainly be good, but for now it is reasonable
- Check out [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) as an alternative solution for simpler synching
